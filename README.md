## Executive Summary:
This project employs HR Analytics to understand and mitigate employee attrition by analyzing various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). By visualizing these KPIs, we aim to uncover critical insights into employee turnover and develop data-driven strategies to enhance employee retention.

## Objectives:
Analyze Employee Demographics and Turnover:
 Understand the distribution and trends in employee demographics and turnover.
Visualize Attrition Trends: 
Use strategic visualizations to illustrate attrition patterns across different dimensions.
Develop Retention Strategies:
 Formulate actionable strategies to reduce attrition based on analytical insights.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Employee Count : Total number of employees in the organization.

Attrition Rate : Percentage of employees leaving the organization within a given period.

Average Age : Mean age of employees.

Average Salary : Mean salary of employees.

Average Years of Service : Mean tenure of employees.

Attrition Count âš : Total number of employees who have left the organization.

## Analysis and Findings:

Attrition by Education:
 Employees with lower education levels tend to leave the organization more frequently. This suggests a potential need for additional support or development programs for these employees.

Attrition by Age: Younger employees, particularly those under 35, show a higher propensity to leave. 

Attrition by Salary Slab: There is a noticeable trend of higher attrition rates among employees in the lower salary brackets. 

Compensation reviews and adjustments may help in retaining these employees.

Attrition by Years at Company: Attrition spikes at the 1-2 year mark and around the 5-year mark suggest that specific retention strategies should be implemented at these critical junctures.

Attrition by Job Role: Roles such as Laboratory Technician,Sales Executive and Research Scientist are experiencing higher turnover, pointing to possible job dissatisfaction or high-stress levels in these positions.

Attrition by Age and Gender: Younger female employees are leaving at a higher rate, indicating a need for policies that address their specific needs and concerns.

## Recommendations:
Enhance Employee Support Programs: Develop targeted support programs for employees with lower educational backgrounds and those in high-stress roles.

Review Compensation Packages: Conduct regular reviews of compensation packages to ensure they are competitive and equitable.
Implement Early Career Development: Provide robust onboarding and career development programs for younger employees to enhance their engagement and retention.

Focus on Critical Tenure Periods: Develop specific retention strategies for employees at the 1-2 year and 5-year marks.

Gender-Specific Initiatives: Introduce initiatives aimed at addressing the unique challenges faced by younger female employees to reduce their attrition rates.

## Conclusion:
By leveraging KPIs and strategic visualizations, this project has identified key areas of concern regarding employee attrition. Implementing the recommended strategies can help the organization reduce turnover, enhance employee satisfaction, and improve overall organizational performance.
